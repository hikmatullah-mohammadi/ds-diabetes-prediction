# Diabetese Prediction
*This is a university project on practicing data science basics*


## Topic and the Problem Statement
Diabetes is a very common disease across the globe. Hence, it's really important to predict if somebody is suffuring from it or not. In this project we will develop a data science model to foretell wether a desired person has diabetes or not. The sooner somebody gets aware that they have diabetes the better they can manage to overcome it. 

The project objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements if a patient is daiabetic or not. The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and we downloaded it from [Kaggle web site](https://www.kaggle.com).
